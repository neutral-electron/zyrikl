        <h3>Introduction to Zyrikl</h3>
        <p>&emsp;Zyrikl is a web scripting language, which means it uses a keyword-based command function experience. Also, Zyrikl uses semicolons (;) to seperate lines. EVERY line must have a semicolon ending it. This means that Zyrikl can easily be compressed. Single-line comments use "//" to start, and multi-line span from "/*" to "*/".</p>
        <p>&emsp;Below is an example:</p>
        <code>echo "Hello, World!";</code>
        <p>&emsp;This will print Hello, World! You can use the "print" statement to print out text, too.</p>
        <code>print "Hello, World!";</code>
        <p>&emsp;It is possible to print images and links. For images, use the "img" keyword to link to an image as the first argument. Links can be inserted using the "link" attribute. The "link" attribute has two arguments, the first of which is the link and the second the text.</p>
        <code>// Here's the image code. ;<br />img "icon.png";<br />;<br />// Here's the link. It will show as "Google link". ;<br />link "https://www.google.com" "Google link";</code>
        <p>&emsp;You can also use different-sized headers:</p>
        <code>// Header demonstration: ;<br/ >;<br />header1 "Largest";<br />;<br />header2 "Second largest";<br />;<br />header3 "Third largest";<br />;<br />header4 "Fourth largest";<br />;<br />header5 "Second smallest";<br />;<br />header6 "Smallest";</code>
        <p>&emsp;Another useful function is the "webdriver" function. It embeds a webpage into your page.</p>
        <code>// The second argument of "" means that you have an ;<br />encryption of null. ;<br />;<br />webdriver "your website" "";</code>
        <p>&emsp;The "img" function is used similarly, with the second argument being encryption.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Two important functions include the "break" and the "line" functions. These do exactly what they sound like.</p>
